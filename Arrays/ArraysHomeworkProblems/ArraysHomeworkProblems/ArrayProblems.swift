//Problem One
//Write an algorithm that moves every element in an array of Ints one space to the left

//Sample input: [0,1,2,3,4,5]
//Sample output: [1,2,3,4,5,0]

func problemOne(arr: [Int]) -> [Int] {

//Problem Two
//Write an algorithm that moves every element in an array of Ints (x) spaces to the left

//Sample input: [0,1,2,3,4,5], 3
//Sample output: [3,4,5,0,1,2]

//Write a function that accepts two strings, and returns true if one string is rotation of the other, taking letter case into account.
// A string rotation is when you take a string, remove some letters from its end, then append them to the front. For example, “swift” rotated by two characters would be “ftswi”.

//Sample input 1: "abcde”, “eabcd"
//Sample output 1: true

//Sample input 2: "abcde", "abced"
//Sample output 2: false

//Sample input 3: "abc", "a"
//Sample output 3: false

    return false
}


//Problem Four
//Given a square matrix of size 3 x 3 , calculate the absolute value of the difference between the sums of its diagonals.

//Input visualization
/*
  1  2  3
  4  5  6
 11  8  9
 */


//Sample Input: [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[11,8,9]]
//Sample Output: 4

//|(1 + 5 + 9) - (3 + 5 + 11)| = |15 - 19| = |-4| = 4

//Problem Five
//Given a square matrix of size n x n , calculate the absolute value of the difference between the sums of its diagonals.

//Input visualization
/*
 4 1 2 5 
 3 1 9 2
 4 1 3 8
 9 2 4 3
 */

//Sample Input: [[4,1,2,5],[3,1,9,2],[4,1,3,8],[9,2,4,3]]
//Sample Output: 13

//|(4 + 1 + 3 + 3) - (5 + 9 + 1 + 9)| = |11 - 24| = |-13| = 13
